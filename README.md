##Overview
This is a short 1 level 3D Adventure Game. The Goal is to reach the tall yellow pole to win. The bean has funny dialogue if you want to talk to him.

##Resources
I used multiple asset websites like Kenney.com, freePBR.com, and some certain websites for a coding tutorial when I was stuck at certain areas.

#Implementation
I used all the assets I downloaded and multiple meshes and character models to create a short scene from beginning to end. 

#Problems
I'd say for whatever reason the biggest problem I had making this assignment was creating the camera. I don't know what it was but I could not get it to move correctly so I ended up settling with a basic over the shoulder camera that follows the player. I unfortunately didn't have enough time to implement the weapon but I wish i could of I had a cool idea where it would somehow knock the bean back.

#Features
Fully playable 3D Character with animations
Camera that follows behind the player
A clear objective that's stated at the beginning of the level
A simple AI for the bean character
A PBR texture for some of the Meshes
A dialogue system
Ramp Terrains and hills to go up and the bean guy will get in your way so I consider that an obstacle
Reports the Player Score at the end.(It's kind of funny)
